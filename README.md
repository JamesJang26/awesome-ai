# Chapter 1. Getting Started

## Project 1.1 Drawing Sketches

In this project we begin by simply sketching a portrait, a pose of a human or an animal, and scene, a building or a landscape. Just draw anything you like, we'll use it later in the book. With this method by combining creativity and AI, we'll make beautiful illustrations, like these:

# Chapter 2. Creative Tools

## Project 2.1 Creative Tools and AI

In this project we begin by simply sketching a portrait, a pose of a human or an animal, and scene, a building or a landscape. Just draw anything you like, we'll use it later in the book.

- **Quick Draw** - Doodling with AI and predictive sketching. This is a great tool to understand how AI can predict what you are thinking to sketch! It also comes with Quick Draw dataset, collected from thousands of drawings! ( [Demo](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/) )
- **Photoshop Neural Filters**, and Adobe Sensei - is the classic digital tool’s window to AI creativity. Explore neural filters that Adobe engineers collected as part of Photoshop. ( [Article](https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/using/neural-filters.html) )
- **Clip Studio Paint AI Colorizing** – another classic illustration and drawing tool very popular with manga and anime artists. This tool includes AI colorizing that allows you to apply color to your sketches. We discuss AI based coloring in depth in this book. ( [Article](https://tips.clip-studio.com/en-us/articles/3939) )
- **Petalica Paint** ( [Demo](https://petalica-paint.pixiv.dev/index_en.html) )
- **OpenAI Microscope** – in this book we discuss neural networks. OpenAI came out with a great tool to visualize neural networks. This is a fantastic tool to understand how images get processed through different types of neural nets. ([Demo](https://openai.com/blog/microscope/))
- **Activation Atlases** ([Article](https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/03/the-building-blocks-of-interpretability.html), [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/lucid/blob/master/notebooks/activation-atlas/activation-atlas-simple.ipynb))

## Project 6.2 Pose Tools for 3D in Art

1. Get assets for this example from [The Art of AI Collection](https://opensea.io/collection/awesomeai) Practical Pose Kit.These assets include a ClipStudio Paint and a Photoshop file. 
2.	Open ClipStudio Paint file with the illustration and select 3D Painter layer (marked with a cube)
3.	Play with changing painter’s avatar position and orientation. Note that the avatar pose includes constraints on joint movements that somewhat correspond to anatomical joints, but you still have the flexibility.
4.	Once you’re happy with the avatar pose, you reduce level opacity to 15-20%, start a new layer, choose your favorite ink pen or a pencil and trace the avatar.
