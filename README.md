In the book you’ll find many illustrations and infographics created and augmented by artificial intelligence. In addition to this book, there’s also a supplemental art book called The Art of AI which includes real art created with artificial intelligence from several artists who participated in this project.

# Practical Projects for the Book

Please, use these supplemental materials and code for the video tutorial [Awesome AI: Design, Art, Games](http://ai-learning.vhx.tv). 

For notebooks, it is recommended that your kernel environment is set to Python 3. Check [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) for dependencies. Some notebooks are available in playground environments like Google Colab and Binder.

# Chapter 1. Getting Started

## Project 1.1 Drawing Sketches

In this project we begin by simply sketching a portrait, a pose of a human or an animal, and scene, a building or a landscape. Just draw anything you like, we'll use it later in the book.
